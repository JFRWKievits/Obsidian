Name meeting: Meeting Alessandra 8
Attendees: A. Menicucci, J. Kievits
Date: 09-12-2022 

### Progress
- T0 chip running with (calibrated) basic network (3 chips)
	- Some background checks show inconsistencies
- Setup ready for testing (physical (ESD mat) & GUI)
- Health checking of FPGA somewhat possible
- FPGA specs:
	- ARM with Linux, applied C
	- Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC ZC706
	- DMA errors might be problematic

### Questions
- Test plan to HollandPTC (everything OK)? 
	- Response wrt flux? - Beam current transmission efficiency is 1nA to 800nA 0.4% , 0.6% for higher (there is a range)
- Exact time that we are expected there - earlier to install everything 15:00 soonest 16:00 (17:30-18:00 beam available) until 23:00 
- You, Peter and I, right? - 
- New beam time slots known? - maybe January 
- Shielding - box 

### Tasks 
- Simulations
- Check inconsistencies
- Shielding material
