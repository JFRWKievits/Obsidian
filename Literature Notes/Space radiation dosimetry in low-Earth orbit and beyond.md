### Background
- Space radiation [[dosimetry]] presents one of the greatest challenges in the discipline of [[radiation protection]]. This is a result of both the highly complex nature of the radiation fields encountered in low-Earth orbit )[[LEO]]) and [[interplanetary]] space and of the [[constraints]] imposed by spaceflight on instrument design.
- Reviews the [[sources]] and [[composition]] of the [[space radiation]] [[environment]] in LEO as well as beyond the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].

### Method
- First the sources of [[ionizing radiation]] in low-Earth orbit )[[LEO]]) and in [[interplanetary]] space are described, as is the production of [[secondary particles]] resulting from interactions between primary charged particles and the mass of a spacecraft and its contents. 
- A section on space dosimetry methods describes both passive and active instrumentation routinely used aboard piloted spacecraft for crew and area dosimetry. 
- The next section reviews dose measurements carried out aboard both US and Russian spacecraft since the inception of human space flight, including data obtained over the history of the Russian Mir Orbital Station and from the US Space Shuttle Program. 
- A survey of the [[radiation environment]] aboard LEO spacecraft emphasizes the dependence of dose and dose-equivalent rates on spacecraft [[shielding]] and [[orientation]] and on [[orbital altitude]] and [[inclination]]. 
- In addition, we review the small amount of extant [[neutron]] dosimetry data measured aboard piloted spacecraft and dosimetry measurements made external to spacecraft. 
- A section on the radiation exposure of crews on missions outside the Earth's magnetosphere presents some estimates of dose equivalent for human missions to Mars. 
- A section on radiation exposure limits for space crews that includes the latest recommendations of the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement]] )[[NCRP]]) follows. 
- Finally we will conclude by summarizing where space radiation dosimetry is today and assessing what still remains to be done in the area of radiation dosimetry for the InternationalSpace Station )ISS) and for interplanetary spacegflight

### Data
- [[Review]] of 66 sources of information

### Results 
- The three principal sources of primary ionizing radiation in LEO:
	- [[GCR]] are charged particlesthat originate from beyond the solar system 
	- energetic [[electrons]] and [[protons]] are trapped in the geomagnetic field and make up the [[Earth's radiation belts]] [[ERB]].
	- [[SPE]]s are high fluxes of charged particles en-countered during rare but intense solar flares and [[CME]]s.
	- [[Albedo]] neutrons and protons are secondary particles, produced in interactions between GCRs and the Earth's atmosphere, with trajectories that take them back up into space (not significant so only sometimes mentioned) 
	- While passing through the skin and structure of a spacecraft, primary particles can undergo nuclear interactions with nuclei that constitute the spacecraft's mass, producing a wide variety of secondary particles. The radiation environment in the interior volume of a spacecraft is thus greatlymodified from the one encountered in empty space.

- GCR:
	- Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles thatoriginate from sources beyond our solar system.The distribution of GCRs is believed to be iso-tropic throughout interstellar space. The energiesof GCR particles range from several tens up to1012MeV and, within the solar system, the GCRspectrum is peaked around 1 GeV. The GCRspectrum consists of 98% protons and heavier ions)baryon component) and 2% electrons and posi-trons )lepton component). The baryon componentis composed of 87% protons, 12% helium ions)alpha particles) and the remaining 1% heavy ionsof charge 3 )Li)±92 )U). Fig. 2 shows the relativeabundances of GCRs [1]. Highly energetic parti-cles in the heavy ion component, typically referredto as HZE particles, play a particularly importantrole in space dosimetry. HZE particles, especiallyiron nuclei which are relatively plentiful comparedto the other highZions, possess high-LET and arehighly penetrating, giving them a large potentialfor radiobiological damage.

	- The ̄ux of GCRs with energy below about 1GeV is aected by the sun's 11-year cycle as shownin Fig. 3 [2]. The GCR ̄ux entering the solarsystem interacts with the solar wind and is par-tially attenuated. This attenuation is greatest dur-ing solar maximum when the solar wind is mostintense. Conversely, GCR ̄ux is greatest during solar minimum when the decreased solar windproduces less attenuation. The dependence ofGCR ̄ux on solar cycle has important implica-tions )vide infra) for long duration space travel toMars and the outer solar system.GCR, being composed of charged particles, isalso aected by the Earth's magnetic ®eld. Chargedparticles tend to follow the lines of the geomag-netic ®eld. Since the geomagnetic ®eld lines areparallel to the Earth's surface near the equator, allbut the most energetic particles are de ̄ected awayby this geomagnetic cuto. The geomagnetic ®eldover the north and south poles points toward theEarth's surface and, at high latitudes, GCR parti-cles are funneled toward the poles. A LEO space-craft receives its greatest exposure to GCR whilenear the poles and a minimum of GCR exposurewhile near the equator. In fact, low-inclinationorbits such as the 28.5°orbit of the Hubble SpaceTelescope and many early Space Shuttle missionsare exposed only to the highest-energy GCR

	- Several models of the GCR ̄ux have been de-veloped over the last several decades. The earlyCREME model of Adams [3] has been largelysuperseded by a number of newer models includingthe Badhwar and O'Neill model [4] and theNymmik model [5]. These new models are basedon the diusion/convection theory of solar mod-ulation, wherein solar modulation is characterizedby a deceleration potential determined fromground-based neutron monitor data. The Nymmik model has been incorporated into the CREME96program and is available for use directly over theInternet [6]
- [[ERB]]s
	- The Earth is surrounded by intense regions ofenergetic protons and electrons referred to as theVan Allen Belts or the Earth's trapped radiationbelts )ERBs). These particles are trapped by thegeomagnetic ®eld where they follow a complexmotion, illustrated in Fig. 4. The charged particlesrevolve around a geomagnetic ®eld line in what iscalled cyclotron motion. Because the geomagnetic®eld is roughly equivalent to that of a dipole, it isnot uniform and the ®eld lines converge near thepoles. This causes the charged particles to move back and forth along the ®eld lines, reversing theirdirections at mirror points near the poles. Finallythere is a drift of the protons to the west and of theelectrons to the east.
	- ![[Pasted image 20220826104745.png]]
	- Trapped electrons occur in two belts or zones.The ®rst, inner zone extends to about 2.4 Earthradii )RE) and consists mostly of electrons withenergies less than5 MeV. The second or outerzone extends from about 2.8 to 12REand containselectrons with energies up to about 7 MeV. Thegap between the inner and outer electron belts isreferred to as the slot region. Electron ̄ux is aboutan order of magnitude greater in the outer zonethan in the inner zone. Since most of the electron ̄ux is of low energy, it is stopped by the shieldingprovided by the skin of the spacecraft. Most of the ̄ux lies below the energy )10 MeV) whereBremsstrahlung X-ray production becomes im-portant. This, in addition to the fact that the mostintense electron ̄uxes occur at altitudes well aboveLEO, means that trapped electrons present littlerisk to human health.Trapped protons occur in only a single regionthat decreases in intensity as a function of distancefrom the Earth. Trapped protons extend in energyfrom several to several hundred MeV and form abroad peak between 150 and 250 MeV. The ma-jority of the trapped proton belt lie at altitudesabove those traversed by the orbit of the ISS.However, due to the fact that the axis of the Earth's magnetic ®eld is slightly displaced from itsaxis of rotation, there is a region o the coast ofBrazil called the south Atlantic Anomaly )SAA)where the geomagnetic ®eld drops unusually closeto the Earth's surface. In the SAA the trappedproton belt intersects the orbits of low-altitudespacecraft such as the Shuttle and ISS. When theISS passes through the SAA, it receives its maxi-mum exposure to trapped protons. For the 51.56°inclination,400 km altitude orbit of the ISS,about half the ionizing radiation dose is fromtrapped protons in the SAA and half is from GCRat higher latitudes [2].
	- Models of the ERB are still based primarily onthe static AP-8 proton [7] and AE-8 electron [8] ̄ux maps. These data, acquired between 1966 and1980, have been combined into the RADBELTmodel available from the National Space SciencesData Center [9]. There have been a number ofeorts to extend these models based on datasetsmeasured by other spacecraft including TIROSand NOAA satellites [10] and the CRRES, SAM-PEX and STRV satellites [11]. A useful Internetsite for calculating trapped radiation exposure isthe SPENVIS website run by Heynderickx [12].
- [[SPE]]
	- The third source of ionizing radiation takes theform of energetic particles emitted by the sun during solar ̄ares and CMEs. These ̄uxes in-cluded electrons, protons and heavier chargedparticles up to iron. From the space radiationhealth perspective, we are most concerned withprotons due to a combination of their relativeabundance and their high energy. Solar particleevents are relatively rare and occur most oftenduring the solar maximum phase of the 11-yearsolar cycle as illustrated in Fig. 5.![[Pasted image 20220826105030.png]]R. Reedy, in: K.S.

	- Solar par-ticle events have been variously de®ned as eventswithtotalproton ̄uences>30MeVof106;3106and 107cm2. The frequency of theseevents is quite varied, but50 such events can beexpected over the course of a single solar cycle. Amajor SPE is de®ned as an event having a proton ̄uence >10 MeV of 1010cm2and one or two events of such a magnitude can be expected persolar cycle.There are two types of SPEs: those produced byimpulsive ̄ares and those produced by CMEs [14].These two types of SPEs are illustrated in Fig. 6. ![[Pasted image 20220826105103.png]] R. Turner, ANSER Technical Report, Arlington, VA,1996.292E.R. Benton, E.V. Benton / Nucl. Instr. and Meth. in Phys. Res. B 184 /2001) 255±294
	- SPEs associated with impulsive solar ̄ares areshort-lived, usually of the order of hours, and arecharacterized by relatively large ̄uxes of electrons.Total ̄uence is small, between 107and 108cm2and these events are restricted to a 30±45°angle insolar longitude. The second type of SPE, associ-ated with large CMEs, is much longer-lived, of theorder of days and is characterized by much larger ̄uxes of protons. Total ̄uence can exceed109cm2and the event can spread over a broadangle in solar longitude extending from 60°to asmuch as 180°.The proton ̄uence spectra from several of thelargest SPEs on record are shown in Fig. 7  ![[Pasted image 20220826105132.png]]J.W.

	- Included in this ®gure is the large SPE of October1989. The dierential proton ̄ux spectrum asmeasured by the NOAA Geostationary Observa-tional Environment Satellite )GOES) 7 during theOctober 1989 series of events is shown in Fig. 8[16].![[Pasted image 20220826105155.png]]NGDC )2001) National Geophysical Data Center on linearchive. http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/GOES/
	- The time pro®le of a typical SPE starts owith a rapid exponential increase in ̄ux, reachinga peak in minutes to hours. Following the peak,there is a gradual decay in ̄ux that lasts of theorder of hours to days. A second peak can arisewhen the interplanetary shock wave produced bythe CME passes the Earth. Such a shock en-hancement can be seen in the October 1989 GOES-7 data at a time just preceding 21 October. TheOctober 1989 event was actually quite unique, not only in its overall intensity, but by virtue of thefact that this was actually made up of a long seriesof SPEs. The magnetic ®eld carried by the SPEshock interacts with the geomagnetic ®eld andthereby lowers the cuto rigidity. This allowslower-energy particles from the SPE to reach lowerlatitudes, leading to an overall enhancement of theLEO dose rate.
- Secondary particles
	- ![[Pasted image 20220826105314.png]]
	- Two types of nuclear interaction between pri-mary charged particles and target nuclei of thespacecraft are of importance ± target fragmenta-tion and projectile fragmentation. Target frag-mentation occurs when a high-energy chargedprimary, typically a trapped or GCR proton, col-lides with a heavy nucleus such as an Al nucleus ofthe spacecraft structure or a C or O nucleus of anastronaut's body. Depending on the kinetic energyof the primary charged particle, the nuclear inter-action can follow a number of dierent channels,producing two or more secondary particles. Thesesecondariescanincludeknockoutprotons,neutrons anda-particles, as well as recoil heavynuclei.Projectile fragmentation occurs when a HZEparticle collides with a target nucleus. Again, de-pending on the energy and charge of the primaryparticle and the angle of the collision, a largenumber of reaction channels are possible. In ad-dition to producing high-energy neutrons andprotons, these reactions can also produce largerprojectile fragments that retain much of the kineticenergy of the primary HZE particle.The secondaries produced by target and pro-jectile fragmentation continue to traverse the vol-ume of the spacecraft and may themselves undergofurther nuclear reactions. This is especially true inthe case of high-energy neutrons. The spacecraftmass can be thought of as a medium in whichhigh-energy charged particles initiate hadroniccascades. In addition,c-rays and neutral pionsproduced in these nuclear reactions can initiateelectromagnetic cascades. Each of the secondaryparticles produced in these nuclear interactionspossesses some potential to cause biologica
	- For anISS type orbit )51.6°inc.,450 km altitude) esti-mates of the neutron contribution to an astro-naut's total dose equivalent range from 30% to60% [17,18]. The quality factor of these neutron ̄uxes tends to be 4±5 times greater than that forcharged particles [19].In LEO, the major source of an astronaut'sneutron dose equivalent is from secondary neu-trons. A smaller fraction comes from low-energyalbedo neutrons from the Earth's atmosphere. Ata particular location within a spacecraft, the neu-tron spectrum depends on the localized shieldingdistribution )quantity and elemental compositionof the mass distribution) surrounding this loca-tion. The neutron spectrum inside spacecraft canbe considered to occupy several discrete energyintervals: )1) evaporation neutrons of energy be-tween 1 and about 20 MeV, )2) intranuclear cas-cade neutrons of energies between 20 and 200MeV, )3) neutrons from the fragmentation of high-energy GCR ranging in energy from between 500MeV and 5 GeV and )4) moderated neutrons withenergy <1 MeV. It is estimated that neutrons ineach of the ®rst three energy regions make aroughly equal contribution to dose equivalent [19].
	- The production of secondary particles has beenmodeled by a number of dierent radiationtransport codes. These codes typically take one ofthe two approaches ± analytic or Monte Carlo.Wilson et al. [20] at the NASA Langley ResearchCenter are developing two analytic codes for thetransport of space radiation through bothtissue and spacecraft shielding materials. TheBRYNTRN program models the transport ofprotons through matter while the HZETRN codeis an extension of the BRYNTRN program toheavy ions. Both codes are based on analyticallysolving the Boltzmann equation in one dimension.The Monte Carlo code most often used for the transport of space radiation is an adaptation of theHETC code ®rst developed at the Oakridge Na-tional Laboratory [18]. HETC lacks the ability totransport heavy ions. Eorts are now underway byArmstrong and Townsend to couple the HETCcode with the HZETRN [21]. More recently, Pin-sky at University of Houston has been working onadapting the FLUKA Monte Carlo code, devel-oped for high-energy applications at CERN, foruse in transporting space radiation [22].
- The demands and constraints placed on in-struments designed to carry out radiation dosi-metry aboard piloted spacecraft are far morestringent than those for nearly all ground-basedapplications as well as for unpiloted satellites andspace probes. These constraints are of three basictypes. First and foremost is crew safety. The op-eration of the instrument and its potential failuremodes cannot in anyway jeopardize crew healthand safety. This applies to obvious things likehigh-voltage power supplies in active detectors,but also applies in more subtle ways ± for example,in the use of glass, the outgassing of polymers, etc.The second type of constraint has more to dowith economics. Because of the high cost oflaunching equipment and supplies into orbit, in-strumentation must be relatively small and of lowmass. The instrument should also be of a robustdesign, able to withstand a large amount of use andabuse without failing, since the on-orbit availabil-ity of spare parts is minimal and cost to return aninstrument to the ground for repair is prohibitive.In space there is always more demand for electricalpower than can be provided by solar arrays so thedetector needs to use as little power as possible.This favors passive detectors and, in some cir-cumstances, battery-operated detectors. Similarly,on orbit, there are always a lot more data needingto be transmitted to the ground than there isavailable bandwidth. This again favors passivedetectors and in the case of active detectors, largecapacity data storage is often required. The sizeand mass constraints that apply to personal dosi-metry on the ground also apply in space. A crew personal dosimeter needs to be small enough andlight enough that it can be comfortably carried bythe astronaut without getting in the way.The third and possibly most challenging con-straint concerns the large dynamic range of sensi-tivities required of the detectors in terms of particleenergy, ̄ux, resolution, etc. Particle ̄uxes are of-ten quite low ± depending on the type of particle,often less than one particle per minute will beregistered by the detector. However, in rare situa-tions such as during a large SPE, ̄uxes can increaseby several orders of magnitude. The dierentsources of primary charged particles combinedwith the eects of spacecraft shielding in modifyingthe primary ̄ux lead to a radiation environmentinside a spacecraft consisting of many dierenttypes of particles and occupying an extremelybroad range of energies. The optimal radiationmonitoring instrument needs to be sensitive to asmuch of this environment as possible. It is desirableto have good charge, energy and LET resolution inorder to identify the dierent particles and to assignappropriate values of quality factor. This is espe-cially relevant in the case of neutrons where it isoften dicult to discriminate between the chargedparticle component and the neutron ̄ux. As in allsituations, active detectors have the advantage oftime resolution over passive detectors

- [[LEO]] 
	- The relative contributions from GCR andtrapped protons to the overall radiation exposureof a spacecraft in LEO are dependent in part onthe inclination of the orbit with respect to theEarth's equator. 
	- The radiation exposure of a spacecraft in LEOis highly dependent upon the altitude, especiallythe altitude at which it traverses the SAA. 
	- The proton ̄ux encountered by a spacecraft asit traverses the SAA is anisotropic.
	- Spacecraft shielding is one of the most impor-tant factors in determining the characteristics ofthe space radiation ®eld inside a spacecraft.
	- In order for an SPE to signi®cantly enhance thedose rate in LEO, a number of conditions must bemet. First, the SPE must possess a large total ̄u-ence. The SPE must occur at a longitudinal loca-tion on the Sun connected to the Earth via theinterplanetary magnetic ®eld so that the particleswill arrive at the Earth and not miss it. There mustbe favorable magnetospheric conditions so thatthe particles can be transported through themagnetosphere and arrive at LEO, without being®rst de ̄ected away by the geomagnetic cuto.Finally the spacecraft has to be in an appropriateorbit. In many cases low-inclination orbits will liebelow the geomagnetic cuto, even if the cutolatitude is reduced due to the magnetic disturbanceassociated with the event
- Interplanetary
	- The radiation environment outside the Earth'smagnetosphere diers markedly from that en-countered in LEO. Not only are the trapped radi-ation belts absent, but interplanetary space lacksthe protection aorded by the Earth's magnetic®eld and the associated geomagnetic cuto. Due totheir high energies, much of the GCR spectrum ishighly penetrating. The cost of launching sucientquantities of shielding is so prohibitive thatshielding against GCR during interplanetaryspace ̄ight is out of the question. As describedabove for LEO, spacecraft shielding can actuallyserve to increase the mean quality factor of theradiation. Since the energy spectrum associatedwith SPEs is signi®cantly lower than that for GCR,shielding can play a critical role in reducing crewexposure from SPE in interplanetary space 
	- While the geomagnetic ®eld provides signi®cantprotection from SPEs to LEO spacecraft, no suchprotection is available to interplanetary spacecraft ̄ying outside the magnetosphere. During a majorSPE proton ̄uxes aboard spacecraft on trans-Lunar or trans-Martian trajectories would besimilar to those measured aboard the geostation-ary GOES satellites.

### Conclusions
- Spacecraftaltitude in the SAA is probably the single mostsensitive parameter on which dose rate depends.Exposure to ionizing radiation in LEO isdominated by trapped protons in the SAA. Evenin more highly inclined orbits such as the 51.56°orbit of the ISS, roughly half the dose is from SAAtrapped protons [2]. Primary trapped protons notonly produce a large fraction of the low-LET)610 keV/lm) dose, they also are responsible for asigni®cant fraction of the high-LET dose equiva-lent in the form of target fragments and high-en-ergy neutrons. For interplanetary space travel,trapped protons in the SAA are obviously not afactor.Historically, major SPEs have not added muchto the total doses measured in LEO. This is largelydue to the protection aorded by the Earth'smagnetic ®eld. The largest SPE observed to dateaboard an LEO spacecraft was the October 1989event as seen on Mir. The total dose measuredaboard Mir by the R-16 operation dosimeter overthe course of the September/October 1989 SPEseries was 40 mGy ± equivalent to about 100 daysaboard Mir during quiescent times [28]. For in-terplanetary spacecraft traveling beyond the pro-tection of the Earth's magnetosphere, SPEs maywell represent the single most important radiationrisk [61
