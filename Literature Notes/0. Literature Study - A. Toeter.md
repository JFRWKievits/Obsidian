## 4. Neuromorphic Computers
- NC aims at either practical applications (like Innatera) or to mimic biology closely (like BrainScales) and this is also true for software
- Time scale of operation (faster/slower than biology)

#### Neural Networks
- Spatially concentrated neural networks are in charge of separate brain functions
- Neural circuits vs large scale brain operation
- Time scale of operations in biological neurons
- Types of neuron models:
	- Hodgkin-Huxley
	- I&F
- SNN
	- Parameters of typical SNN
	- Proof that an SNN can be used for computation

#### Neuromorphic Architectures
- Comprehensive table of neuromorphic architectures
- Types of systems (analog, digital, photonics?)
- Limitations of each type (synapse fan-in)
- No studies on power consumption, radiation hardness and accuracy of SNNs on NC hardware

## 5. Brain Adaptation
- Brain adaptation in biology and relation to radiation mitigation

#### What is brain adaptation?
- Three shortest timescales for brain adaptation: 
	- Decades (from baby to adult)
	- Days and hours (learning, memory, attention)
	- Milliseconds (state changes)

#### How does the brain adaptation work?
- Mechanisms of brain adaptation
	- Redundancy
	- Reorganisation
	- Niche construction
	- Timing of developmental trajectories
- Neuroplasticity
	- Neural coding schemes (rate/frequency, temporal, population, sparse) (?)
	- No direct bridge with synaptic neuroplasticity (structural plasticity) and radiation hardness found
- Portability of brain adaptation concepts to neuromorphic hardware
	- Important to realize the limitations set by the used NC hardware (digital/analog)
