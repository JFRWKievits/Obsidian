### Background
- Biological research into [[structural plasticity]] 

### Method
- Reviews 40 years of former studies on [[structural plasticity]] in the context of recent experimental studies. 
- Compares spontaneous and experience-dependent [[structural plasticity]] with lesion-induced (reactive) structural plasticity that occurs during development and in the adult brain.

### Results
- Research papers of computational models of [[neural development]]
- Research papers of [[biological processes]] of [[neural development]]

### Data 
- Research papers of [[biological processes]] of [[neural development]]

### Conclusions
- [[structural plasticity]] is not only an integral part of [[neural development]]; it is also ubiquitously present in the mature brain.

### Significance
- New 'neuron-centric view' presented for [[structural plasticity]]

### My Notes
- Maybe relevant for [[mitigation strategies]]
