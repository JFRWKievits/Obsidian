### Background
- Topical review on consolidated [[large-scale]] [[neuromorphic computing]]

### Method
- Literature review of four [[neuromorphic computing]] systems

### Results
- a survey of the features of the brain that are modelled in neuromorphic systems
- a brief history of the early development of [[neuromorphic computing]] and more recent advances
- descriptions of the main features of current [[large-scale]] [[neuromorphic computing]]
	- IBM [[TrueNorth]] chip (distributed [[digital]] neurons, real-time cognitive applications, [[off-line learning]])
	- Stanford [[Neurogrid]] (real-time sub-threshold [[analog]] neural circuit)
	- Heidelberg [[BrainScaleS]] machine (wafer-scale above threshold [[analog]] neural circuits running 10,000 times faster than biological real-time aimed at biological systems)
	- Manchester [[SpiNNaker]] machine (real-time [[digital]] many-core system, implements neural and synapse models in software running on small embedded processors, aimed at biological systems.)
- a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses ofeach of these large-scale systems

### Data 
- Uses information from the separate [[neuromorphic computing]] platforms

### Conclusions
- The four [[large-scale]] systems are different but can be compared using:
	- energy per(synaptic)connection
	- modelling speed
	- model flexibility
	- physical modelling

### Significance
- Provides information dense presentation of different [[large-scale]][[neuromorphic computing]] systems

### My Notes
- Useful table for overview: ![[Pasted image 20220623114731.png]]
