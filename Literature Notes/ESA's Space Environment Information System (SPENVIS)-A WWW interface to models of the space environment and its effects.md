### Background
- [[SPENVIS]] provides standardized access to models of the hazardous space environment through a user-friendly online interface
- SPENVIS is designed to help spacecraft engineers perform rapid analyses of environmental problems and, with extensive documentation and tutorial information, allows engineers with relatively little familiarity to produce reliable results.

### Method
The radiation tools include: [[radiation belt]] [[models]]: the [[NASA]] models AP-8 and AE-8l, the AFRL models CRRESPR02 and CRRESELE3, and models developed recently4 (in the framework of [[ESA]] TRP contacts) with data sets including SAMPEX5, CRRES/MEA6 and AZUR7, and a model of the low-altitude trap- ped [[proton]] anisotropy. solar proton models: JPL-85*, IPL-91â€™ (see Fig. l), KinglO; CREMP for cosmic rays. The conversion of geographic to magnetic coordinates is done internally without interference from the user, ensuring consistency in the application of field models, often a source of confusion and error. Internal and ex- ternal magnetic field models can also be run separately to study the distribution of the magnetic field and re- lated parameters over an orbit or a grid of geographic coordinates, or to generate and visualise magnetic drift shells. SPENVIS Contains the SHIELDOSE12 and SHIEL- DOSE-2 codes for total dose assessment and the EQ- FRUX13 and EQFRUXGA codes for solar cell damage- equivalent fluences (1 MeV electron equivalent). Fig- ure 2 shows the equivalent fluences of trapped protons and electrons and solar protons in a GaAs solar cell for an 8OOkrn heliosynchronous orbit. These tools have been augmented by a code for computing the Non-Ion- izing Energy Loss (NIEL)14 or non-[[ionizing]] dose. This parameter is gaining importance since it represents the best way to quantify the environment for assessing [[displacement damage]] effects such as charge transfer effi- ciency [[degradation]] of CCDs, and is now proposed as a better parameter for solar cell damage assessment. Fig- ure 3 shows the NIEL of trapped and solar protons for an 8OOkm heliosynchronous orbit, as a function of Al shield radius.

In conjunction with CREME and the trapped and solar proton models, the user can compute [[single event upset]] [[SEU]] rates from cosmic and solar ions and trapped and solar protons (shown in Fig. 4 for an 800 km heliosyn- chronous orbit). In computing all these parameters, spacecraft or solar cell coverglass shielding is taken into account. Figure 5 shows the shielded differential solar proton spectrum for an 8OOkm heliosynchronous orbit, for different Al shield radii. A geometric tool to calculate shielding distributions for simple spacecraft geometries is currently under development. The trapped particle models can also be run on a co- ordinate grid. Figure 6 shows the AE-8 MAX electron flux > 2 MeV on an invariant coordinate grid.
