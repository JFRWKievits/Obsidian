### Background
- Basically the first introduction of a [[spiking neural network]]

### Method
- The [[computational power]] of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other [[conventional neural network]] models.
- Multiple hypotheses with multiple mathematical proofs.

### Results
- Multiple mathematical proofs.

### Data 
- Only uses mathematical analysis, no data.

### Conclusions
- Networks of spiking neurons have, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, more [[computational power]] than these other neural network models. 
- A single spiking neuron can compute a [[biological function]] which requires hundreds of hidden units on a [[conventional neural network]]. 
- Any function that can be computed by a small [[conventional neural network]] can also be computed by a small [[spiking neural network]]. 

- ### Significance
- A mathematical analysis of the [[computational power]] of networks of a [[spiking neural network]] had so far been missing.
