### Background
- [[spacecraft electronics]] are susceptible to [[space radiation]]

### Method
- The earth's [[space radiation]] environment is described in terms of charged particles as relevant to effects on [[spacecraft electronics]]. 
- The nature and magnitude of the trapped and transiting environments are described in terms of [[spatial distribution]] and [[temporal variation]].
- The internal radiation environment of the spacecraft is described in terms of shielding the high-energy particles of the free-field environment. 
- Exposure levels are presented in terms of ionizing radiation dose and particle fluence for comparison to [[electrical devices]] susceptibility.

### Results
- Trapped [[proton]] and [[electron]] fluxes in [[LEO]] are provided ![[Pasted image 20220628145228.png]] ![[Pasted image 20220628145245.png]] 
- Effects of [[electron]] exposure in virtually all modern microcircuits are dominated by accumulated ionization.
- Effects of [[proton]] exposure over the energy range of interest in the space environment include both ionization and atomic [[Displacement Damage]]

### Data 
- A lot of tabular data of fluxes of [[electron]], [[proton]] and [[heavy ion]]

### Conclusions
- There are considerations to be made to make [[spacecraft electronics]] more [[fault-tolerance]]
- The Earth [[space radiation]] is fairly benign compared to other more extreme locations

### Significance
- cited over 400 times

### My Notes
- extensive paper on [[space radiation]] environment
