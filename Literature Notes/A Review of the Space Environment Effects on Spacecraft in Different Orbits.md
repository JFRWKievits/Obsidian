### Background
- The space environment consists of various complex phenomena, which could have a stronginfluence on the spacecraft operation in different aspects. Since the very beginning of space exploration,numerous studies have been done on the space environment. However, most of the existing literature focuseson the investigation of the details of environmental phenomena, while the space environment has rarelybeen discussed from the perspective of orbits types. Therefore, a comprehensive review on analyzing andcomparing the environmental characteristics among diverse [[orbits]] [[orbit]] in space is of great significance.

### Method
- In this paper, a review of the space environment and itseffects on spacecraft in different orbits are given. 
- In Section 2 the main space environment components are briefly investigated, including the neutral atmosphere, the plasma, the [[radiation]], the macroscopic particles, the geomagnetic field,the temperature field, and solar activities. The geomagnetic field and solar activities are only discussed in Section 2, because they are usually apt to influence other [[environment]] components other than directly affect the spacecraft.
- In Section 3 and Section 4, the typical space environment components of LEO and M&H are classified. Specifically,the characteristics, effects on spacecraft, analyzing models, and preventing measures of these components are introduced,respectively. The unique properties of the two regions arepresented by comparing the different behaviors of the same environment components.
