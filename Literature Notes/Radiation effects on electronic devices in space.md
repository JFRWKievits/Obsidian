### Background
- [[space radiation]] is a known phenomena and many instances can be mentioned where [[space radiation]] led to adverse effects in [[electrical devices]]

### Method
- literature review
- Math/[[computational model]] review

### Results
- The space radiation environment is divided into three categories:
	- [[radiation belts]] ([[electron]] (up to 30 MeV) and [[proton]] (up to 500 MeV) "stable")
	- [[solar flares]] ([[proton]] (up to 500 MeV) and [[heavy ion]] (up to 10 MeV/nucleon)
	- [[cosmic rays]] ([[heavy ion]]whose energy levels can reach thousands of GeV)
- The [[radiation effects]] the particles can have in [[semi-conductor]] devices:
	- [[Total Ionising Dose]] (TiD) effect by homogeneous accumulation of ionising dose deposition over a long time in insulators. It is mainly due to [[electron]] and [[proton]] and leads to parametric [[degradation]] of the electrical performance of devices.
	- [[Displacement Damage]] effects (DD) due to lattice defects caused by the accumulation of [[non-ionising dose deposition]] due to [[proton]] or high energy [[electron]].They are very critical in some classes of [[electrical devices]] (sensors, CCD, amplifiers...) and induce [[degradation]] of electrical parameters or increased background noise
	- [[Single Event Effect]] (SEE) induced by sudden high [[ionising dose deposition]], from a single particle, in a sensitive region of the devices. This instantaneous perturbation is due to [[proton]] and [[heavy ion]] and leads to functional anomalies in most kinds of devices.
- Explains how [[heavy ion]] lose energy in matter
- Explains how [[proton]] may cause an indirect [[Single Event Effect]] ![[Pasted image 20220628134405.png]]
- Pickel and Blandford model ([[heavy ion]])
- Formulas for modelling [[Single Event Effect]]
- Example of correlation between [[SIngle Event Upset]] and [[proton]] flux
- Two main standards are widely used within the frame-work of SEE testing
- For modelling:![[Pasted image 20220628140238.png]]
- The modelling of [[proton]]-induced [[Single Event Effect]] has been investigated by several authors for years


### Data 
- Previous papers

### Conclusions
- [[Single Event Effect]] issues emerging: 
	- (1) in ever more complex devices, failure modes are numerous with sometimes orders of magnitude of differences in associated sensitivities
	- (2) the increasing speed of devices makes SED and SET more and more critical in digital devices
	- (3) with smaller IC feature sizes, combined effects lead to failure mechanisms that are not completely understood and/or modelled (SHE,MBU,...)
	- (4) the wider use of COTS in space systems poses several practical problems when dealing with accelerator testing

### Significance
- 

### My Notes
- Nice combination of info on [[Single Event Effect]]
