### Background
- [[survey]] on [[neuromorphic computing]] which is already major research field for both academic and industrial actors.

### Method
- Provides a comprehensive [[survey]] of the research and motivations for [[neuromorphic computing]] over its history.
	- a 35-year review of the [[NC motivations and drivers]] of neuromorphic computing
	- major [[NC research areas]] of the field
		- [[NC models]], [[NC algorithms]] and [[NC learning]] approaches
		- hardware and devices
		- supporting systems
		- [[NC applications]]
	- discussion on the [[NC next steps]]


### Results
- [[NC models]] (from most complex to least complex):
	- Biologically-plausible [[neuroscience]]
	- Biologically-inspired [[neuroscience]] & [[spiking neural network]]
	- Neuron+Other [[neuroscience]] & [[spiking neural network]]
	- Integrate-and-fire [[spiking neural network]]
	- McCulloch-Pitts [[conventional neural network]]
- [[NC learning]] 
	- [[supervised]] works well but restrictive
	- [[unsupervised]] has a lot of opportunity but not demonstrated well

	- Hardware
		- [[digital]]
		- [[analog]]
		- [[mixed signal]]
	- Supporting systems
		- Communication (inter-chip or intra-chip)
			- [[Address Event Representation]] (AER) (inter-chip mostly)
		- Supporting software
			- New hardware systems
			- Existing hardware systems (mapping or programming)
	- [[NC applications]]

### Data 
- Over 3,000 papers from a 35-year time span looking primarily at the motivations, neuron/synapse models, algorithms and learning, applications, advancements in hardware, and briefly touching on materials and supporting systems.

### Conclusions
- [[neuromorphic computing]] is awesome and has many benefits, unfortunately there are still areas that need attention

### Significance
- Provides a full view of the types of research that has been done in [[neuromorphic computing ]]across a variety of fields. As such, all of the references in this version are included that can be used to fill gaps in knowledge.

### My Notes
- Nice representation of [[NC motivations and drivers]] throughout time:![[Pasted image 20220621141333.png]]
