### Background
- Research and commercial players are focusing on development of neural processing units.
	- In-Space: R&D Phase, no known successful in-space demonstration.
	- Non-Space: Demonstration and early market introduction phase.

### Method
- Mentions leading [[NC hardware]] innovators 
- Specific triggers which may enable [[NC hardware]] to advance towards successful space [[NC applications]]
- General R&D and commercial efforts that will most likely contribute to future space sector [[NC next steps]]

### Results
- Future [[NC applications]] in space:
	- Object identification and Change Detection
	- Autonomous Control
	- Cybersecurity
	- [[bandwidth]]
- Nice overview of [[NC hardware]] and projects:![[Pasted image 20220630142546.png]]
- [[NC research areas]] are mentioned
- [[NC motivations and drivers]] are mentioned with a focus on market

### Data 
- Historical literature [[survey]]

### Conclusions
- It is reasonable to expect that [[neuromorphic computing]] will eventually prove to be a game changer for [[spacecraft electronics]] because it has demonstrated the potential to overcome constraints on power and speed to enable agile information systems
- Successful introduction of [[neuromorphic computing]] to space applications will depend on the space sector’s ability to “spin-in” [[NC next steps]]

### Significance
- By The Aerospace Corporation that advises the government on complex space enterprise and systems engineering problems.
