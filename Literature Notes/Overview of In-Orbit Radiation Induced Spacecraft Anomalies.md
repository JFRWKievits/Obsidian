### Background
- [[radiation effects]] in space to [[electrical devices]] has been known for a long time

### Method
- describes a few known cases of cumulative or transient effects in Earth or planetary environments. 
- discusses investigation methodology, and issues such as the statistical aspects of probabilistic anomalies in the assessment of cause to effects relationships, and the necessity of multi-field experts in group root cause analysis, from [[radiation effects]], to satellite fault determination, to identification and re-configuration strategy. 
- A focus on some practical cases of [[anomaly]] analyses will be made

### Results
- ![[Pasted image 20220630100631.png]]
- Classification of [[anomaly]] occurences:
	- [[orbit]]/mission type distribution ([[GEO]], [[LEO]], non-Earth missions) i.e., environment type distribution ([[outer belt]], [[inner belt]], interplanetary, planetary)
	- Position of the set in the [[solar cycle]] (the variability of the above environments)
	- Spacecraft lifecycle: young, mature or aging spacecraft
	- The history of on-board/ground operations to circumvent anomalies
	- Recurrence of platforms, platform equipment ([[COTS]]), payload or instruments
- [[SIngle Event Upset]] occur more often than any other [[anomaly]]:![[Pasted image 20220630101535.png]]
- Some historical cases of [[anomaly]] in satellites
- 
### Data 
- results of two studies, by [[NASA]] and Aerospace Corporation

### Conclusions
- Studying radiation effects enables engineering progress
- [[radiation effects]] [[anomaly]] have their origin at the [[electrical devices]] level but the observed anomaly is a system response, and it is important to know how the system works that may “filter” the symptoms for a good analysis. 
- The random nature of the [[Single Event Effect]] phenomena can lead to surprising behaviors which should beknown to satellite operators and final customers.

### Significance
- Comparison of different types of [[anomaly]] over past few decades

### My Notes
- Nice representation of the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]]![[Pasted image 20220630095258.png]]
