### Background
- [[neuromorphic computing]] needs diodes, [[memristor]]s and capacitors that can be realized using Nb2O5 MIM diodes

### Method
- three important factors are considered when studying [[radiation effects]] on the diodes:
	- rectification
	- hysteresis
	- capacitance
- Voltage sweeping is not usable since there will be significant charging and discharging of as-processed defects.
- Evaluates the C–f and Gm–f characteristics of metal–Nb2O5−x–metal devices of two dielectric thicknesses with (small) dc or 0 V bias applied, before and after 10-keV [[X-ray]] irradiation with 0 V bias, small positive [[bias]] (+0.5 V), and small negative [[bias]] (−0.5 V)
- Evaluates the rectification and hysteresis properties of these[[ electrical devices]] through the full range of typical device operation.

### Data
- Own experimental research
- Evaluates the radiation response, in a repeatable way, and avoids high voltages when devices are characterized in the capacitive mode of response, consistent with their use in actual [[integrated circuit]] operation

### Results 
- Experimental results
	- Current–Voltage Characteristics
	- Capacitance-Frequency Characteristics
		- Diode maintains the ability to store charge under low-frequency ac bias even after repeated cycling (<100Hz)
		- Decrease in capacitance leads to difficulties in circuit applications
- demonstrates that bias-induced charging is more significant in these MIM structures than radiation-induced charging. This is because of the large density of as-processed border traps near the interface, which dominate the rectifying, hysteretic, and capacitive characteristics of these devices.


### Conclusions
- In all cases, the devices show high tolerance to X-ray irradiation. These results demonstrate the utility of C–f measurements in characterizing the radiation response of MIM diodes in the capacitive mode of operation, and reinforce the promise of these devices for [[neuromorphic computing]] applications even with [[space radiation]]
- neuromorphic circuits are designed to adapt to small changes, capacitors are typically only biased for short times during circuit operation, and these capacitors primarily only change the charging rate of a given node. 
- The applied voltage controls the frequency of oscillation, and the control resistor has to be within a certain range set by the parameters of the device. Hence, the circuit will still operate unless the turn-ON or turn-OFF voltage shifts enough that the control resistor is no longer within the required range

### Significance
- These results illustrate the promise of metal–Nb2O5−x–metal devices as neuristor circuit elements in the future space applications,although follow-on tests of working circuits with integrated capacitors are required for confirmation

### My Notes
- Nice description of important characteristics of [[neuromorphic computing]] [[material systems]], [[electrical devices]] and [[radiation effects]]
