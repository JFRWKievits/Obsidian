### Background
- [[ESA]] report on bio-inspired lander

### Method
- Simulates the operation of a neuromorphic [[vision]] [[sensor]] in planetary landing scenarios, at four different levels. 
	- lowest level characterizes the response properties of the sensorâ€™s individual blocks
	- intermediate level derives analytically the individual circuit block behavior and carry out full-chip simulations
	- third level implements a simulink model of the sensor
- Evaluates the overall performance of the chip in this specific task.

### Data 
- Own research

### Results
- The Neuromorphic [[vision]] [[sensor]] used in this work is a recently developed asynchronousevent-driven motion chip, named Tracker Motion Sensor

### Conclusions
- [[neuromorphic computing]] can be used for [[vision]] [[sensor]]s
- [[analog]] systems have benefits over [[digital]] systems in space

### Significance
- [[ESA]] report
