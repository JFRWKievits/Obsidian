### Background
- Conductive bridging random access memory ([[CBRAM]]) resistive memories are shown to be susceptible to ionizing radiation effects during neuromorphic pulse programming

### Method
- Provides a setup for [[testing]] [[NC hardware]]
- Uses an irradiation chamber (no targeted beam or [[electron]], [[proton]] or [[heavy ion]] characteristics mentioned)
### Results
- Shows that [[CBRAM]] devices can be incrementally programmed during 60Co gamma-ray irradiation with [[radiation effects]] observed with increasing dose.
- DC programming is shown not to be affected by [[Total Ionising Dose]], confirming observations from previous [[Total Ionising Dose]] studies.

### Data 
- Own experiment

### Conclusions
- No ionizing [[radiation effects]]were observed during the dc programming of either [[CBRAM]] technology. 
- [[radiation effects]] were observed during neuromorphic programming for both types of devices. 
- All irradiated [[CBRAM]] devices experienced a decrease in the maximum obtainable conductance state with an increase in [[TID]]. 
- Neuromorphic programming requires uniform pulses to adjust the weight of the artificial [[synapse]]. The observed [[TID]] effects would degrade the learning ability of the [[synapse]]s, requiring higher power pulses to adjust the synaptic weight.

### Significance
- Combination of [[neuromorphic computing]] and [[radiation effects]]
