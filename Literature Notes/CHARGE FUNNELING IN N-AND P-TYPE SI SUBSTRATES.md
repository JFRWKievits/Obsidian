### Background
- Enhanced [[charge collection]] via [[funneling]] may increase the vulnerability of [[integrated circuits]] to single particle induced [[upsets]] or errors.
- [[soft errors]] in [[semiconductor]] material due to energetic [[SIngle Event Upset]] have been reported and concern has risen about the effect when integrated circuits shrink in size.
- Enhance charge collection by rapid drift currents (ie. field funneling effect) has increased this concern.

### Method
- Measure charge collection for p+ - n [[junctions]] in n-silicon and the results are compared with the corresponding results for n+-p junctions in p-silicon.
- An analytic expression, that estimates the prompt charge collection, is derived and validated using [[physical experiments]] [[radiation experiment]] results. This expression can be used in analyses determining circuit susceptibility to single-particle upsets.

### Data
- In the experiments [[alpha]] particles from a 241Am source (nominal [[energy]]=5.4MeV) were allowed to strike the samples, and the signal was recorded.
- Obtained data on prompt charge collection as a function of applied [[bias]], [[doping density]], and [[polarity]] in five varieties of p-n junctions and in one [[MOS]] [[capacitor]] structure.

### Results 
- Drift charge collection compared with model in p-type samples![[Pasted image 20220816161213.png]]
- Drift charge collection compared with model in n-type samples ![[Pasted image 20220816161300.png]]

### Conclusions
- The considerably enhanced collected charge over the amount of charge deposited in the initial depletion layer is strong evidence that charge [[funneling]] occurs in p-n junctions. 
- In [[capacitor]]s funneling does not appear to be significant.
- From the comparison of the charge collection for the n+-p and p-n junctions with the same substrate doping density, it is clear that the charge funneling effect is considerably more pronounced for the n+-p junctions in p-Si, as expected on the basis of the difference in mobilities of [[electrons]] and [[holes]] in [[silicon]].
