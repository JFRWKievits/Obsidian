### Background
- [[memristive]] devices and [[memristor]]s are promissing for memory applications and show good radiation resistance

### Method
- Discusses a number of concerns related to [[memristor]]s and [[radiation effects]]:
	- device to [[device variation]]
	- [[device degradation]] during switching
- Reports testing of TaOx and TiO2 devices under [[bias]] during ionizing radiation with gamma rays ([[electron]]s) and [[heavy ion]]s

### Data
- Provides experimental setup with [[electron]] and [[heavy ion]] [[particle energy]]


### Results 
- The [[resistance]] of the [[memristive]] devices changed with and without irradiation 
- The test structures are sensitive to damage from electrostatic discharge ([[ESD]])
- Damage may occur to the electrodes due to [[heating]] during switching
- [[gamma]] radiation does not have a lot of [[radiation effects]]![[Pasted image 20220705115507.png]]
- [[heavy ion]]s do have [[radiation effects]] ![[Pasted image 20220705115450.png]]

### Conclusions
- There is [[device variation]] but this will likely be improved in an [[integrated circuits]] device. The difference between states will affect the [[fault-tolerance]] of devices to [[radiation effects]] but any changes are usually small.
- [[memristive]] devices have shown some sensitivity to applied [[bias]] that are likely not large enough to cause problems with the operation of thememory, but can be large enough to affect the interpretation of radiation test results
- [[heating]] may affect the long-term reliability of devices ([[device degradation]]), even in [[integrated circuits]]
- [[memristor]]-based [[RRAM]] devices are tolerant to extremely high levels of radiation
- Improvements are needed for application in [[spacecraft electronics]] due to reliability issues concerning:
	- [[radiation effects]]
	- [[device variation]]
	- [[device degradation]]

### Significance
- Describes [[radiation experiment]] for [[NC hardware]]

### My Notes
- Uses [[test standard]]: MIL-STD-883G, Method1019.7
