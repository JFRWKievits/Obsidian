In order to understand what the radiation model must do, several different need and requirements must be taken into account.

# Stakeholders
- Space industry
	- Satellite manufacturers
	- OBC developers (Ubotica)
- NMC companies
	- Innatera
- Scientific community
	- TU Delft
	- Researchers in NMC, SNN, space electronics 

Main stakeholder is Innatera

# Need
Innatera needs to see how radiation influences the operation of an SNN on the Innatera chip to enable the development of a mitigation technique to keep network performance at an acceptable level.
