## Possible effects

#### Overall
- Electron-hole pair generation in the oxide leads to almost all total dose effects (Schwank, 2008).
- TheCTT device is evaluated as a candidate device for analog-based neuromorphic hardware.Given the nonvolatile nature of the CTT-based weights, it is found that the CTT is resilienttosoft errorsbut is susceptible to large VTHshifts due to Total-Ionizing Dose (TID) whichis especially more pronounced in fully-depleted SOI technologies (Moran, 2022).


#### Gate Oxide
- In MOS structures, the trapped charge causes a shift in the gate threshold voltage. Since the trapped charge resulting from ionisation is positive, n-type MOSFETs experience a reduction in threshold voltage and not always is completely switch off when no external bias is applied. Conversely, p-type MOSFETs experience a increase in threshold voltage and become harder to drive (from ECSS 2010).
- At threshold, interface traps are predominantly positively charged for p-channel transistors and negatively charged forn-channel transistors (Schwank, 2008).
- Positive charge trapping in the gate oxide can invert the channel interface causing leakage current to flow in the OFF state condition. This will result in an increase in the static power supply current of an IC and may also cause IC failure (Schwank, 2008).
- Mobility (which affects switching speed and drive current) is also degraded thereby decreasing switching speed and drive current (from ECSS 2010).
- The number of holes that are trapped isgiven by the capture cross-section near the interface, which isdependent on the appliedfield and is very device fabricationdependent, with only a few percent of the holes being trappedin hardened oxides to as much as 50 to 100% for soft oxides.The positive charge associated with trapped holes causes anegative threshold-voltage shift in both n- and p-channel MOStransistors. (Schwank, 2008)
- Radiation-induced-hole transport typically depends on oxidethickness approximately ast4ox[3], [21], with variations intransport rates observed due to differences in oxide processingand defect densities [3], [24]–[28] (Fleetwood, 2018)
- Charge transport and trapping in irradiated MOS devicesdepend strongly on applied electric field, temperature, doserate, and thickness of the oxide (Fleetwood, 2018)
- ![[Pasted image 20220926141525.png]](Fleetwood, 2018)
- For these devices and irradiation condi-tions, the shifts are similar regardless of whether the devicewas irradiated at high rate and annealed at the same bias,or irradiated at a lower rate for an equivalent time. Thisis true for both oxide- and interface-trap charge [61], [63] (Fleetwood, 2018)
- Significant enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS) isobserved primarily in linear bipolar devices [69], as opposedto MOS devices, because linear bipolar devices are morelikely to have oxide layers with high defect densities thatare irradiated at low electric fields under worst case useconditions [70], [71] (Fleetwood, 2018)
- Fixed oxide trappedcharge can have a significant impact on the dc parametersof CMOS devices and integrated circuits. One of the mostimportant and well-studied effects is the negative shift in thedc drain current versus gate-to-source voltagefor both n-and p-channel MOSFETS (Barnaby, 2006)
- Fortunately, radiation damage to thin oxides does not seem tosignificantly add to the problem. In their comparison of TIDeffects in 350 nm, 250 nm, and 180 nm CMOS technologies Manghisoniet al., reported that after 10 Mrad of total dose theworst case increase inwas only a factor of two for both n-FETs and p-FETs biased in saturation during radiation ex-posure (Barnaby, 2006).
- One of the greatestthreats to deep submicron CMOS today is the reliability of thegate oxide. Due to its extremely small thickness (around 2 nmfor most 130 nm nodes), the oxides are easily damaged leadingto increased carrier leakage from gate into the underlying sub-strate. The impact of radiation only exacerbates the gate leakageproblem (Barnaby, 2006)
- RILC is characterized byelectron tunneling via neutral traps created in the oxide layer byradiation exposure. RILC is a function of the electricfield in the oxide during radiation exposure, as exhibited by thedata shown in Fig. 32, [61]. In this plot, the abscissa is the elec-tricfield in the oxide during irradiation and the ordinate is themagnitude of gate current density through the oxide. The whitecircles and black squares denote the leakage response for 2 V and -2V, respectively applied to the gate during measurements. This strong field dependence suggests that the radiation-inducedoxide traps are not generated directly by radiation interactionsbut rather byfield dependent processes similar to those related to hole trapping in the oxide. In addition to the radiationfield and measurement bias de-pendence, RILC increases nearly linearly with dose and is notsurprisingly a function of oxide thickness. The gate current density for these technologies is a near linearfunction of dose and increases significantly as the oxide thick-ness is scaled from 6 nm to 4 nm. The higher leakage for thethinner oxide is likely due to the increased probability of elec-tron tunneling into and out of the radiation-induced border trapdefects (Barnaby, 2006).

- ![[Pasted image 20220927110454.png]]
- The results, shown in Fig. 34, indicate that total dose expo-sures on this technology do not have a significant impact ongate leakage up to 30 Mrad [62]. It should be noted that theresearchers who published this work caution that these mea-surements were performed on a specific process at a specificthickness (3.2 nm), which is relatively thick by today’s stan-dards [62]. Further reductions in oxide thickness may increase agate oxide’s susceptibility to high-energy photons, electrons, orprotons due to increased tunneling probabilities. Another openquestion is whether or not RILC susceptibility will be large rel-ative to preirradiation leakage specification in more advanced,aggressively scaled technologies.

#### Oxide traps (defects in the SiO2 layer)
- Because oxide-trap charge ispositive for both p- and n-channel transistors, oxide-trap chargeand interface-trap charge compensate each other for n-channeltransistors and add together for p-channel transistors (Schwank, 2008)
- The most im-portant deviation from thedependence occurs in very thinoxides, where tunnel annealing eliminates, or at least neutral-izes, trapped charge near the interface. The point is that for thinoxides, this annealing process occurs at both interfaces and ac-counts for all or nearly all of the trapped oxide charge. For thinenough oxides, the two tunneling fronts meet in the center of theoxide, leaving no net positive oxide charge (Oldham, 2003)
- For thin enoughoxides, electrons can tunnel directly from the substrate to thegate contact, and the level of such current that can be toleratedis an important constraint on the design of a circuit. RILCis a variation on this idea in that a radiation-induced defectincreases the substrate-to-gate tunnel leakage current. Thebasic idea is that electrons tunnel from the substrate to a trapstate in the oxide, which is induced by radiation, and thenthe electron also tunnels from the trap to the gate contact. (Oldham, 2003)

#### Border traps (oxide traps that exchange charge with the Si substrate)
- Unlike N_ot, the charge state of the switching trap can vary with bias. As such, the signature effect of border traps on MOSFET dc parameters is similar to the- effect of interface traps (Barnaby, 2006)

#### Interface traps (defects at the Si/SiO2 interface)
- Large concentrations of interface-trap charge can decrease the mobility of carriers and increase the threshold voltage of n-channel MOS transistors. These effects will tend to decrease the drive of transistors, degrading timing parameters of an IC (Schwank, 2008)
- Conversely to bipolar, MOS semiconductors benefit from annealing during and after irradiation, and therefore per unit TID, suffer less damage when irradiated at lower dose rates. It is therefore important that component test data are selected carefully (from ECSS 2010).
- P-channel transistors at threshold areaffected primarily by interface traps in the lower region of theband gap. Therefore, for a p-channel transistor, interface trapsare predominantly positive, causing negative threshold-voltageshifts. Conversely, traps in the upper portion of the band gap arepredominantly acceptors; i.e., if the Fermi level is above the trapenergy level, the trap“accepts”an electron from the silicon. Inthis case, the trap is negatively charged. Interface traps predom-inantly in the upper region of the band gap affect an n-channeltransistor at threshold. Therefore, for an n-channel transistor,interface traps are predominantly negative, causing positivethreshold-voltage shifts (Schwank, 2008).
- in general,there does not appear to be a“true”dose-rate dependence forthe buildup of interface traps in MOS device. As long as the total irradiation plus anneal time isthe same, the same threshold-voltage shift due to interface trapsis measured, regardless of the dose rate of the radiation source  (Schwank, 2008).
- However, higher temperatures are normally re-quired to observe significant interface-trap annealing. These properties make interface-trap charge effects very im-portant for low dose-rate applications, e.g., space. For n andp-channel MOS transistors, interface traps affect device perfor-mance primarily through an increase in threshold voltage and adecrease in channel mobility. Both of these degradation mech-anisms tend to reduce the drive current of“ON”transistors,leading to increases in timing parameters of an IC (Schwank, 2008)
- However, unlike border traps, inter-face trapsare located exactly at the interface. Thus, thereis essentially no barrier to trapping and detrapping of carriers inthe near-surface Si. Interface traps can therefore have a signif-icant effect on carrier mobility and recombination rates of car-riers at the semiconductor surface (Barnaby, 2006)
- Interface traps are primarily dangling bond defects called Pb centers [34]. The most important and abundant of these centers is called the Pb0 center. A secondary contribution is provided by a closely related defect called Pb1 (Barnaby, 2006)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927093635.png]]
- One of the principle ef-fects of interface trap buildup is an increase in the subthresholdswing of a CMOS device i.e., a characteristic stretch out in drain curret versus gate-source voltage response for both n- and p-channel devices. (Barnaby, 2006) ![[Pasted image 20220927094108.png]]
- The radiation-induced build-up of switching states (interfacetraps and border traps) can significantly increaseflicker or 1/fnoise in CMOS devices [28], [40]. An increase in 1/f noise isdetrimental to the phase noise of high frequency transceiverfront-end circuits (e.g., mixers and voltage controlled oscilla-tors) as well as base band communications applications suchas data converters andfilters [41] (Barnaby, 2006)

#### Field Oxide
- In addition to the gate oxide, ionisation also affects the field oxide, which is used for isolation in MOS integrated circuits. This results in extremely large leakage currents if the threshold shifts are large enough to cause inversion. Field oxide failure is an important failure mode for many commercial CMOS devices (from ECSS 2010).
- Positive charge buildup in field oxides can cause large increases in IC static power supply leakage current (caused by parasitic leakage paths in the transistor). In fact, for advanced ICs with very thin gate oxides, radiation-induced charge buildup in field oxides normally dominates the radiation-induced degradation of ICs (Schwank, 2008).
- A relatively small dose in a field oxide ( 10 krad(Si) for some commercial devices) can induce sufficient charge trappingto causefield-oxide induced IC failure. Because of this, radia-tion-induced charge buildup infield oxides is the main cause ofIC failure in advanced commercial technologies (Schwank, 2008)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927095855.png]] (Barnaby, 2006)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927100038.png]] 
- The results in Fig. 18 suggest that as witholder CMOS technologies, radiation-induced increases in TIDdefects in modern STI structures is linearly related to the expo-sure level (Barnaby, 2006)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927100242.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20220927100318.png]] (Barnaby, 2006) 
- In the table, it is seen that the STI has the largest damage factor andthus has the greater trapping efficiency. This may be due toeither a higher density of hole trapping defects or a greatertrapping cross-section for holes in the STI. The results suggestthat the radiation tolerance of modern trench isolation structuresmay actually be worse than other isolation technologies (Barnaby, 2006)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927100534.png]]
- Radiation-induced degradation in shallowtrench isolation oxides is typically caused by exposure to highfluxes of ionizing radiation. Micro-doses of damage brought onby a single ion strike have also been observed in ultra smallCMOS technologies [50]. Damage to the STI can cause a sig-nificant increase in the standby current in modern CMOS inte-grated circuits. (Barnaby, 2006) The causes of increased standby current are leakage pathscreated as a result of TID defect buildup in the shallow trenchisolation structures of the 130 nm technology. These leakagepaths include: 1) drain-to-source leakage in a single n-channelMOSFET, 2) drain-to-source leakage between two different de-vices, and 3) source-to-well leakage between two different de-vices.
- ![[Pasted image 20220927101104.png]]
- Drain-to-Source Leakage:Charge trapped in the iso-lation dielectric, particularly at the Si/SiOinterface along thesidewalls of the trench oxide, creates a leakage path whichbecomes the dominant contributor to off-state drain-to-sourceleakage current in n-channel MOSFETs (n-FET) (Barnaby, 2006)
- At the present time, interdevice leakage does not seem tobe a great TID-threat in modern CMOS technologies. Recentexperiments onfield oxide transistors fabricated in two sepa-rate commercial 130 nm processes indicate that off-state currentper unit width remains below 1 nA/m after 500 krad(SiO)of total dose. Thus, interdevice leakage at the 130 nm tech-nology node is more than a factor of two less than single de-vice drain-to-source leakage (Fig. 22). Whether these trendscontinue when technologies scale to smaller feature sizes is un-known at the present time (Barnaby, 2006)
- 

#### Testing considerations
- At high dose rates and short times, little neutralization ofoxide-trap charge will occur andcan be large and neg-ative. Conversely, interface-trap charge will have had insuffi-cient time to build up andis normally small. Thus, athigh dose rates and short times for either n- or p-channel tran-sistors, the threshold-voltage shift can be large and negative. Foran n-channel transistor (gate or parasiticfield oxide transistor),large negative threshold-voltage shifts can significantly increasethe drain-to-source leakage current, which in turn causes signif-icant increases in IC static supply leakage current,, leadingto potential IC failure (Schwank, 2008)
- At moderate dose rates, some neutralization of oxide-trapcharge will take place and some buildup of interface traps willalso occur. Thus, for this case, bothandcan belarge. For an n-channel transistor,andtend tocompensate each other. Therefore, at moderate dose rates, eventhough the individual components (and) of thethreshold-voltage shift can be large, the net threshold-voltageshift for an n-channel transistor can be small and the radia-tion-induced failure level of an IC may be relatively high (Schwank, 2008)
- For the long times associated with low-dose-rate irradiations,a large fraction of the oxide-trap charge in transistors may beneutralized during irradiation. Thus,is often small. Incontrast, the long times associated with low-dose-rate irradia-tions allow interface-trap buildup to saturate. This results in apositive increase in threshold voltage in n channel transistorsand a decrease in carrier mobility. The buildup of interface trapsin gate oxides is primarily important for older technologies andother device types (e.g., power MOSFETs) with relatively thickoxides. For present-day gate oxides, the gate oxide thicknessis normally very thin. As will be shown below, radiation-in-duced charge buildup rapidly decreases with decreasing oxidethickness. As a result, interface-trap buildup (and oxide-trappedcharge buildup) in gate oxides is often not a concern and totaldose effects are dominated by oxide-trapped charge buildup infield oxides, even at low dose rates (Schwank, 2008)
- Switching oxide (border) traps can also change charge state as the dc gate-to-source biasis varied. Thus, in dc measurements, it is difficult to distinguishthe effects of interface traps (centers) and switching oxidetraps (near interface E’centers). The key difference betweenthe two defect types is that the charge exchange frequency atswitching E’centers is low (Hz) compared tocenters(kHz) [38], [39]. Therefore, independently measuring theeffects and/or densities of either defect type requires ac ornoise measurement techniques (e.g., ac conductance, chargepumping, or 1/f noise).

#### P-channel vs. N-channel
- For p-channel transistors, bothandare negativeand they add together. At high dose rates,can be large.At low dose rates,can still be large because standardbias conditions for a p-channel transistor do not lead to signifi-cant oxide-trap charge neutralization via tunneling. In addition,can also be large, especially for thick oxides (e.g., para-siticfield oxides). Therefore, for both high and low dose rates,the threshold-voltage shift for p-channel transistors can be largeand negative. The net result is that for parasitic p-channelfieldoxide transistors, the threshold becomes larger, decreasing theeffect of radiation-induced charge buildup in parasiticfield ox-ides (over p-type regions) on radiation-induced degradation (Schwank, 2008)
- In most works comparing the radiation-induced degradationof MOS devices at laboratory and space environments, MOS de-vice response at low dose rates can be estimated by irradiatingdevices at laboratory dose rates and annealing devices postir-radiation under bias. This is because the mechanismsfor MOS device degradation at laboratory and low dose rates arenormally the same. This is unlike enhanced low dose rate sen-sitivity (ELDRS) that is often observed in bipolar devices where the amount of radiation-induced degradation can be sig-nificantly more at low dose rates than at laboratory dose rateseven after a long-term anneal of the laboratory dose rate irradi-ated devices. Recent work has shown that ELDRS effects canalso be observed in MOS devices. In this work, the edgeleakage current due to radiation-induced charge buildup infieldoxides of nMOS transistors was more at low dose rates than atlaboratory dose rates followed by an equivalent long-term an-neal. The enhanced degradation at low dose rates was attributedto space charge in thefield oxides altering the the spatial distri-bution of trapped holes and lowering the annealing rate at lowdose rates (Schwank, 2008).
- The 28 nm planar bulk transistors were found in general to be TID-tolerant with very small threshold voltage shifts. However, some TID effects were seen depending on device geometry. Some subthreshold leakage current was seen for the nMOSFETS, and long, narrow channel pMOSFETs saw threshold voltage shifts after irradiation to very high doses (Brewer, 2021)

- A technology that is seeing increased use in space is sil-icon-on-insulator (SOI). SOI transistors are built on an insu-lating layer, which reduces the amount of p-n junction area. Thereduced junction area leads to lower parasitic capacitance andfaster device operation. The absence of a conducting path under-neath the MOS transistor completely eliminates parasitic pnpnpaths that can cause latchup. The biggest difference between theradiation response of MOS transistors fabricated on bulk siliconsubstrates and SOI transistors is due to the buried oxide of SOItransistors. Up to 100% of the holes generated by irradiation canbe trapped in defects in the bulk of the buried oxide. The buildupof charge can invert the bottom surface of the silicon channel ofa MOS/SOI transistor, creating a back-channel leakage current.However, techniques are available that can mitigate the effectsof charge trapping in the buried oxide. One transistor designthat has been successfully applied to reduce the effects of radia-tion-induced trapped charge in the buried oxide is the BUSFET (Schwank, 2008).
- For a fixed I_d, the radiation-induced buildup of N_ot shifts the bias point more negative (i.e., by deltaV_ot). In n-channel MOSFETs, this shift leads to a reductionin threshold voltage and an increase in off-state and drivecurrents. In p-channel MOSFETs,V_t increases negatively,while off-state and drive currents are reduced (Barnaby, 2006)
- ![[Pasted image 20220927093016.png]] (Barnaby, 2006)
- The mechanism of charge exchange is dependenton the nature of the oxide trap. For example, the’defectcan simply capture and reemit trapped holes [23]. This processhas been shown to be more likely in pMOS transistors [23]. InpMOS transistors, the’defect has a high hole capture crosssection and a relatively low barrier for reemission relative to nMOS devices [23] (Barnaby, 2006)

###### Total dose calculation
![[Pasted image 20220920155945.png]]
- where rho is the mass density of the material, phi(E) is the differential energy spectrum defined between E1 and E2, and dE/dx is the stopping power in units of energy loss per unit particle pathlength.

###### Yield of electron-hole pairs
![[Pasted image 20220920161759.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220920161911.png]]
- where f(Eox) is the hole yield as a function of oxide electric field (from fig above), D is the dose, and tox is the oxide thickness (in unitsof cm). g0 is a material-dependent parameter giving the initial charge pair density per rad of dose (per rad for SiO2) (Schwank, 2008).


For a gate oxide transistor, parasiticfield oxide transistor, orback-channel transistor of an SOI device (discussed below), thetotal threshold-voltage shift is the sum of the threshold-voltageshifts due to oxide-trap and interface-trap charge, i.e.:
![[Pasted image 20220922090920.png]]
where rho is the charge distribution of radiation-induced oxide-trapped or interface-trap charge. Note the change in signbetween the charge distribution and the threshold-voltage shift.For positive charge, the threshold-voltage shift is negative; con-versely, for a negative charge, the threshold-voltage shift is pos-itive. Thus, for devices where oxide-trap charge dominates, thethreshold-voltage shift will be predominantly negative (Schwank, 2008).

A. Pair Generation
From the 17eV (Silicon) value, one can calculate the charge pair volume density per rad: 8.1 x 10^12 pairs/cm3-rad (Oldham, 2003)

B. Recombination
The fraction of holes es-caping recombination,, is determined mainly by two factors: the magnitude of the electric field, which acts to sepa-rate the pairs, and the initial line density of charge pairs createdby the incident radiation. The pair line density is determined bythe linear energy transfer (LET), and is, therefore, a function ofthe incident particle type and energy. The line density is also in-versely proportional to the average separation distance betweenelectron/hole pairs; obviously, the closer the average spacing ofthe pairs, the more recombination will occur at a given field, andthe less the final yield of holes will be (Oldham, 2003)

![[Pasted image 20220926145236.png]]

C. Hole Transport
1) Transport is highly dispersive,taking place over many decades in time following a radiationpulse. 
2) It is universal in nature, meaning that changes in temperature, field, and thickness do not change the shape or dispersion of the recovery curves on a log-time plot. Changes in these variables affect only the time-scale of the recovery.
![[Pasted image 20220926150459.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220926150527.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220926150559.png]]
4) The transport is field activated. 
5) At temperatures above about 140 K, the transport is strongly temperature activated, but it is not temperature activated below about 140 K. 
6) The hole transport time, or recovery time, has a strong super-linear power law dependence on oxide thickness

D. Deep Hole Trapping and Annealing
Generally,trappedholeannealingcanproceedbyeitherof two processes, tunneling or thermal excitation. At or near roomtemperature, tunneling is the dominant mechanism, but if the tem-peratureisraisedenough,thethermalprocesswilleventuallydom-inate. Tunneling has been analyzed by several authors [52]–[58],as has the thermal process [59]–[71]. Both processes can give riseto the linear-with-logdependence that has been observed empir-ically [53]–[55], but one has to make different assumptions aboutthe trap energy level distribution for the two processes (Oldham, 2003)

E. Interface Traps 
In the first stage of thisprocess, radiation-induced holes transport through the oxide,and free hydrogen, in the form of protons. In the second stage,the protons undergo hopping transport (following the CTRWformalism described above). When the protons reach the inter-face, they react, breaking the SiH bonds already there, formingHand a trivalent Si defect. One of the critical experimentalresults is shown in Fig. 17 [90], [101], which shows the resultsof bias switching experiments. For curve A, the sample wasirradiated under positive bias, which was maintained throughoutthe experiment, and a large interface trap density eventuallyresulted. For curve B, the bias was negative during irradiationand hole transport, so the holes were pushed away from theinterface, but the bias was switched positive after 1 s, duringthe proton transport. The final number of interface states forcurves A and B is almost the same, however. For curve E, thebias is maintained negative throughout both stages, and interfacetrap production is suppressed completely. For curves C and D,the bias is negative during irradiation and hole transport butswitched positive later than for curve B. In all cases, bias polarityduring the hole generation and transport made no difference,but positive bias during the proton transport was necessary tomove the protons to the Si/SiOinterface. McLean also worked outthe average hopping distance for protons to be 0.26 nm, which isthe average distance between oxygen atoms. And, he determinedthe activation energy for the interface trap buildup to be 0.82 eV,which is consistent with proton transport [109]. Saks eventuallysucceeded in monitoring the motion of the protons directly (Oldham, 2003)
![[Pasted image 20220926151919.png]]

Voltage shift in thin oxides is not significant (Oldham, 2003):
![[Pasted image 20220926160108.png]]

Dose enhancement as a functionof oxide thickness is indicated in Fig. 24 for testing with an X-ray source, dose enhancement is an importanteffect, which means that the dose is different in different partsof the structure (e.g., gate oxides and field oxides). On the otherhand, in a Co60 source, the mass absorption coefficient for allthe materials shown in Fig. 23 is essentially equal, and the doseis uniform because charged particle equilibrium is maintained (Oldham, 2003)
