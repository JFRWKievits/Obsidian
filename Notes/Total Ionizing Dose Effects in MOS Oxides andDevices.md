### Background
- The study of [[space radiation]] and [[MOS]] materials, [[electrical devices]] and [[integrated circuits]] has been a major theme for decades.
- Many individual investigators have studied parts of the [[radiation effects]] and a reasonable degree of understanding has now been achieved.

### Method
- an overview is given of the [[time-dependent]] [[radiation effects]] in [[MOS]] systems, before discussing each of the major physical processes in greater detail. ![[Pasted image 20220629103623.png]]
- the implications of the [[radiation effects]] for [[testing]], [[prediction]], and [[hardness assurance]]
- the implications of [[scaling]](reducing the oxide thickness) and issues associated with oxide isolation structures and [[leakage current]]s.

### Results
- Basic physical processes
	- [[Electron-Hole Pair Generation Energy]] (value of about 17eV)
	- [[Initial Hole Yield]] (determined by [[electric field]] and [[line density]] which is determined by [[Linear Energy Transfer]] and thus by incoming particle, [[geminate]]/[[columnar]])
	- [[Hole Transport]] 
		- 1) Transport is highly dispersive,taking place over many decades in time following a radiation pulse. 
		- 2) It is universal in nature, meaning that changes intemperature, field, and thickness do not change the shape or dispersion of the recovery curves on a log-time plot. Changes in these variables affect only the time-scale of the recovery.
		- 3) The transport is field activated. 
		- 4) At temperatures above about 140 K, the transport is strongly temperature activated, but it is not temperature activated below about 140 K. 
		- 5) The hole transport time, or recovery time, has a strong super-linear power law dependence on oxide thickness.
	- [[Deep Hole Trapping and Annealing]] (quantum interactions, dipole model most likely)
	- [[Radiation-Induced Interface Traps]]
- The implications of the [[radiation effects]] for [[testing]], [[prediction]], and [[hardness assurance]]
	- [[Rebound or Super-Recovery]] (only a problem on [[n-channel]] devices)![[Pasted image 20220629112612.png]]
	- [[Apparent Dose Rate Effects]] (normally does not matter, use [[linear systems theory]])
	- [[Nonlinear Effects]] (hole trapping may saturate with dose, due to trap filling, space charge effects related to [[ELDRS]], recombination of trapped holes with radiation-induced electrons, or a balance between hole trapping and tunnel annealing)
	- [[Charge Separation Techniques]]
	- [[Dose Enhancement ]] ([[MOS]] having multiple layers instead of one material)
	- [[Implications of Scaling]] (stuck-bit, radiation-induced leakage current, mobility degradation)

### Data 
- Historical research papers [[survey]]

### Conclusions
- Generally, the [[radiation effects]] are very complex, with many different physical processes contributing. 
- Each of these processes has a different time dependence, field dependence, and temperature dependence. 
- Even though the overall, combined response is extremely complex, a high level of understanding has now been achieved by isolating the different mechanisms and by studying them one at a time
