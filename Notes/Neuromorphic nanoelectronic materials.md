### Background
- [[neuromorphic computing]] is already established but new materials might offer better performance

### Method
- review progress in the emerging field of neuromorphic [[nanoelectronic]] materials with a focus on how nanomaterials enable unique neuromorphic responses compared to inorganic and organic materials

### Results
- Introduces multiple devices used for [[neuromorphic computing]] [[synapses]]
	- [[transistor]] - robust, allows multiple gate channels, large footprint
	- (vertical) [[memristor]] - smaller size, 3D stacking enabling, combines induction and memory
- Shows 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D [[nanoelectronic]] materials

### Data 
- Previous research papers into [[neuromorphic computing]] materials

### Conclusions
- [[nanoelectronic]] materials are very promising but more work is needed

### Significance
- Summarizes current challenges with conventional [[neuromorphic computing]] components and describes large range of [[nanoelectronic]] solutions

### My Notes
- Neuromorphic computing hardware requires physical models at three different [[levels]]: 
	- individual components such as artificial synapses and neurons; 
	- networks of these neurons and synapses; 
	- learning rules and training methods
