### Background
- For a long time the existence of a memory transistor ([[memristor]]) was stipulated, now it has been found by researchers at HP.

### Method
- research into electrical propterties at nanoscale

### Results
- A model of the behavior of certain components using [[memristor]] and [[memristive]] formulas

### Data 
- Own studies of TiOx devices (i–v behaviours)
- Experimental observations in various [[material systems]]: 
	- organic films, that contain charged dopants or molecules with mobile charged components;
	- chalcogenides, where switching is attributed to ion migration rather than a phase transition; 
	- metal oxides, notably TiOx
	- various perovskites

### Conclusions
- The rich hysteretic i–v characteristics detected in many thin-film, two-terminal devices can now be understood as memristive behaviour defined by coupled equations of motion: some for (ionized) atomic degrees of freedom that define the internal state of the device, and others for the electronic transport.

### Significance
- First introduction of a physical [[memristor]] or [[memristive]] device
