### Background
- [[conventional neural network]] have shown great performance but [[spiking neural network]] might be better for embedded applications

### Method
- Reimplements the tests performed by Deng 2020 using different [[SNN model]], [[SNN algorithm]], [[SNN learning]] to study how these factors affect the [[SNN accuracy]].
- Compares the classification a[[SNN accuracy]] of a two-layer [[conventional neural network]] to a two-layer [[spiking neural network]] using the MNIST dataset.

### Results
- Provides a lot of simple explanation on [[spiking neural network]]
- [[SNN accuracy]] of 80% on MNIST compared to 88% of [[conventional neural network]]
- Also worse performance for Bernoulli and temporal encoding

### Data 
- Own research

### Conclusions
- All of the SNNs that used a neural model without an adaptive threshold value performed poorly compared to the Diehl and Cook model
- Multiple possible explanations for poor accuracy (time-dependence not included)

### Significance
- Not that significant (MSc paper)

### My Notes
- Nice entry level paper
