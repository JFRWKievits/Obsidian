### Background
- Aims to explore event-based sensingand processing in the context of computer vision systemsand to suggest ways that biological approaches may offeradvantages in areas such as rapid and online learning

### Method
- present examples of [[event-based processing]] of images and motion detection 
- overview of [[SpiNNaker]][[event-based processing]] 
- describes an [[SNN algorithm]] where [[structural plasticity]] can be used to learn input features

### Results
- describes a model for [[structural plasticity]] based on biological inspiration

### Data 
- own research using [[SpiNNaker]] and a [[spiking neural network]] that only employs [[structural plasticity]] and no [[[spike timing dependent plasticity]]]

### Conclusions
-
### Significance
### My Notes
- Paper by Peter
