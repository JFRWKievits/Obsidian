### Background
- Radiation-induced soft error has become a key threat to advanced commercial [[electrical devices]] and systems.
- 
### Method
- Briefly reviews the types of failure modes for soft errors
- Three dominant radiation mechanisms responsible for creating soft errors in terrestrial applications
- How these soft errors are generated by the collection of radiation-induced charge
- The soft error sensitivity as a function of technology scaling for various memory and logic components
- Presents applications that are most likely to require soft error mitigation

### Results
### Data 
- simulation of 180-nm logic and logic test structures used to measure 130-nm and 90-nm logic SER data

### Conclusions
- The soft error sensitivity of various memory and logic devices used to create advanced commercial electronic systems as a function of technology scaling has been presented.
- The author has shown that while the SER of [[DRAM]] in a system is relatively unchanged by scaling, [[SRAM]] and peripheral logic system SER are increasing rapidly with each new technology node. 
- The cost and efficacy of various methods to mitigate soft errors have also been reviewed along with the conclusion that the most effective way to improve memorysy stem soft error reliability is to employ [[error-detection]] techniques

### Significance


### My Notes
- Not that interesting, mainly terrestrial applications
