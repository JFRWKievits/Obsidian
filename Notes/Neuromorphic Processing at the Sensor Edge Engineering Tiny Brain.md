### Background
- The number of chips and sensors will increase very much over the coming decades
- Cloud operation not always possible

### Method
- [[Innatera]] development

### Results
- [[biological processes]] described and [[computational power]] described
- Increasing number of [[synapses]] by M improves the signal-to-noise ration by the square root of M (roughly) but comes at M times greater cost (power?)

### Data 
- Historical papers and [[Innatera]] data 

### Conclusions
- [[spiking neural network]] and [[neuromorphic computing]] are well suited for sensor edge

### Significance
- Extensive view of [[Innatera]] vision
