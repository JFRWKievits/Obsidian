Date: 11-11-2022 

### Progress
- Wrote test plan for first test at HollandPTC on 13th - pencil beam (size & spread)
- Making simulations and GUI for quick analysis during test
- Meeting with Akke - scope definition
- Meeting with Abhi - testing subtleties 

### Questions
- Bottom-up approach of test levels (eg. LEO-GEO)? - For Abhi, use-case was clear and characterization was already performed. Therefore, use bottom-up now.
- Back or front irradiation preference? - Check if alignment matters 
- Temperature exploration? - Use as secondary goal/addition
- Can I be in touch with HollandPTC? - Martha is responsible 
- How many test windows likely possible in January? - Not possible to say for sure. Per 3 months at least 3.
