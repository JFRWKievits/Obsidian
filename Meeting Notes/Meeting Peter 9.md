Name meeting: Meeting Peter 9
Attendees: J. Kievits, P. Bogdan
Date: 11-10-2022 

### Progress
- Working on synfire chain model
- David Moloney

### Questions
- Hardware for handover is the C0? Why not use B0?
	- B0 might also not be usable in case C0 fails -> devise contingency plan
- Aditya mentioned some spike I/O model that can be used for SEE testing?
	- Probably synfire or non-network
- Approaching SEE testing, resetting, running - how to begin?
	- Test plan
- Useful to investigate several neuron models (with noise)? Or tune parameters over some ranges?

### Tasks
- Focus this week:
	- Finish ideal synfire chain (representative and tunable)
	- Make list of relevant circuit characteristics (pMOS, nMOS, etc.) to ask from analog team
- Modelling a mock chip to be able to tell what type of measurements can be expected
- Test plan with description of experiments
	- Couple of weeks for non-network
	- For synfire chain, additional week
	- For mitigation strategies, more additional weeks

- Bias driven network
- Synfire chain
- Run function/analyze function - communicate via file

- Check increasing frequency of office visits in begin November

- Reach out to David Moloney (include Peter)
