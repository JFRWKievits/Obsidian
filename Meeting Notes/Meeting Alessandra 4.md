Name meeting: Meeting Alessandra 4
Attendees: A. Menicucci, J. Kievits
Date: 06-10-2022 

### Progress
- Meeting analog team
- SEU: Investigating RPP method in CREME
- TID: Investigating similar technology node sizes and analog
- Meeting with analog teamlead tomorrow

### Questions
- Feedback on literature study?
	- Not yet, next thing on the list
- Feedback on email? 
	- It highlights the difficulty of this subject
	- What are his conclusions based on? (experiences/intuition, in any case check this)
	- This might be scientific enough
	- Most likely we see the macroscopic voltage shift change
	- In the case of NMC this is even more complicated
	- With 3D NAND,
	- No circuit diagrams 
	- Perhaps SPICE, GEANT4

- Innatera joined the consortium as an outside partner
- Alessandra also interested in their main goals for this research

### Tasks 















Becky
- Why did you have the presentation on NMC?
- What power envelope is Ubotica targeting? (Cubesat and up?)
	- (ie. is power budget of ~2W accurate?)
- How deal with see/ionizing dose (not mentioned in paper)?
- Do you think more AI in space necessary? (eg. laser communication)
