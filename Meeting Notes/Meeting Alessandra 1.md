Name meeting: Meeting Alessandra 1
Attendees: A. Menicucci, J. Kievits
Date: 11-07-2022 

### Progress

### Questions
- Focus on single event effects and total ionizing dose (no displacement damage)?
	- SEE: Test for all different types? (most interesting one, DD not relevant, Ake Toeter contact for literature research, all companies will be different, error propagation is relevant here)
	- TID: Check for ELDRS and Annealing? (Cobalt-60 with reactor institute, "pretty sure we can do this", more straightforward, less interesting for the model)
- Use test standard (MIL-STD-883) to device tests?
	- Facility particle max. energy is 250	MeV while protons in LEO up to 500 MeV (nobody tests with high-energy protons, particle flux of middle-range energies is most relevant)
	- How translate to real environment? (no strange things needed) 
		- RQ: What energy and particle types are the most interesting?
		- (diving into test standards is not necessary, new space tech requires new methods "this is the innovation of the thesis", read it and understand what is the good way to test)
- Is there a contact at Holland PTC?
	- How small can beam target be? (point size beam but bigger would be possible)
	- Have other (space) electronics tests been performed?
		- (Holland PTC is also contacted by Hyperion and ESA) 
		- (Holland PTC is only there for technical support, is the same for all parties in this sector, you say: what day, what size beam, what beam characteristics, test plan (longer than the actual time slot), calibration of floating gate dosimeters MOSFET using William de Meyere (take a look at his thesis), Abimanyu is working for lunar zebro)

- Hand in preliminary literature research & project plan for feedback
	- Alessandra will mainly look at the table of content
- Have you seen the agreement between TUD - Innatera?
	- Person of TUD who takes care of agreement is out of office 

### Tasks 
- Send preliminary literature research & project plan for feedback
- Contact Akke Toeter
- Contact William de Meyere
- Contact Tom Hendrix
