Name meeting: Meeting Peter 13
Attendees: P. Bogdan, J. Kievits
Date: 15-11-2022 

### Progress
Meeting Alessandra:
- Use bottom-up approach for testing
- Check if alignment matters for back or front irradiation
- Make temperature characterization a secondary goal
- I cannot be in touch with HollandPTC but Alessandra has emailed them about beamsize
- Per 3 months at least 3 test windows, we're aiming for 3 windows at least for this research

GUI:
- Did not get as far as I hoped
- Best to use Dash probably, bit more mature than Streamline (both are far better than tkinter it seems)

Networks:
- Spiking seems to saturate with given parameters for characterization_network

### Questions
- Any progress on the information I asked for? 
- T0 check-up? 
- The dimensions (or names) of the boards we will use 

### Tasks 
- 3D printing model
- Pointing of beam
- GUI 
- Networks (fix Git)
- Check for spiking saturation (and other possible behavior) - base spiking rate 100 kHz +/- 10% (max. 200 kHz)
