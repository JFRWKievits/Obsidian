Name meeting: Meeting Peter 12
Attendees: P. Bogdan, J. Kievits
Date: 08-11-2022 

### Progress
- Reviewed test plans from other students
- Made example test plan 
- Basically a lot of variation between previous HollandPTC work

### Questions
- Any progress on the information I asked for? 
- This week T0 check-up? - Not yet, this week
- 3D printing? - I have to do it
- What do you need from me? (Non-network.py, Analysis.py using spike trains)
- What levels: Good with bottom-up approach. Use some anchor - ask Alessandra

Questions Peter
- We're going for smallest
- Data is in batches on fpga, local timestamps in GUI for starting and stopping recording. Power consumption, all neurons or serially, spikes out. Use 5 windows: baseline/nominal, irradiation, after irradiation, bias individual neurons (difficult to show), after reinitialization
- Super important to get as much data as possible
- For serial neuron, spiketrain minus 1 using timedelta as timestamp
- Plot ISI boxplot for each neuron
- Violinplot
- Mock test 
- Back or front irradiation - ask Alessandra
- Add to synaptic weights section (if we have time) - stimulate one neuron and checking what this does
- Non-network -> characterization network
- Temperature -> ask Alessandra
-
