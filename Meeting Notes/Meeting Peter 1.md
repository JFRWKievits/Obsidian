Name meeting: Meeting Peter
Attendees: P. Bogdan, J. Kievits
Date: 11-07-2022 

### Progress
- Synfire chain
- Brian
- Biometric landing papers (not useful)
- Thesis radiation effects simulation OBC
- Point target for beam collimation
- Perhaps Cobalt-60 for TID testing

### Questions
- Focus on SEEs most relevant but also account for TID okay?
	- That is fine, however we want to use that simplest chips (to prove hardware) and those might not be able to run a network. There is discussion among Innatera wrt to this. Would need access to additional tools for modelling analog systems. 
	- Would be great to get a first sense of types of tests. With Cobalt-60 TID testing it might be difficult to check which component is failing. We cannot share everything that is on the chip with you.
- Look at preliminary literature study?
	- Yes
- Innatera visit before/after holiday?
	- Covid is happening, therefore likely after holiday
- Idea is not to use test standards for chips (prefer behavior over testing) okay?

### Tasks 
- Details of test setup
- Synfire chain description
