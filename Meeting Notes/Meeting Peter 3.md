Name meeting: Meeting Peter 3
Attendees: P. Bogdan, J. Kievits
Date: 16-08-2022 

### Progress
- Had meeting with other student who tested at HollandPTC
	- Tests are fairly easy to do (only 3 parameters to tune: beam size, flux, energy)
	- People are very relaxed (separate timeslots for research)
	- About 1 month leadtime for reserving timeslot
	- First to use this for electronics (since then couple more students/researchers)
	- Chose energy to limit total ionizing dose effects
	- Time has to be used efficiently
- Investigated earlier synfire work by Abeles and Gewaltig
	- Made synfire chain using Brian based on that literature
- Alessandra is back in office, expect reply soon
- Reviewed literature from another student (under Alessandra's supervision) who investigates structural plasticity as a mitigation strategy (purely theoretical) 
	- Fairly convinced structural plasticity is the answer but requires more power

- This week likely not that much progress due to a death in the family and music festival 

### Questions
- Feedback on draft literature report?
- Why would a synfire chain be useful? (operate at edge of stability?)
	- Easy to understand and reason about
- Do you have any long holidays planned?
	- No
- Do you think I need to request a holiday for this week?

### Tasks 
- Use feedback to structure the rest of the literature research
- Unsupervised learning?
- Presentation first week of september or so
- Ask Peter for clarity on type of chip (and network) that can be used for experimental testing
