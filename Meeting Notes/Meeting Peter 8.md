Attendees: P. Bogdan, J. Kievits
Date: 04-10-2022 

### Progress
- Jupyter notebook based on brainstorm (for representation, show ISI locally)
- Sent update to Alessandra
- Reached out to Ubotica (space AI company)
- SEU: Started investigating IRPP method in CREME
- TID: Investigating similar node sizes and analog

### Questions
- How does (AER) communication work on the chip? In case there is a pulse in a neuron that is not connected to any other neurons (based on non-network) can it still propagate through physical connection to other neurons?
- Do you want to join chat with Aditya?

### Tasks 
- Have some transfer from current pulses to outputs 
- Have a boxed in interpretation of calculated guesses 
- How do electrical characteristics influence the pulses?

- Contributing test setup for system without full visibility (black box)
- Sensitivity analysis (lesion studies)
- Write down literally what you want to do
